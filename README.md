# Natural_Language_Processing
This project aims to create an extensive SMS spam classification system utilising machine learning and natural language processing methods. With the growing number of smartphones and SMS use, the problem of SMS spamming has grown more common, causing issues for both consumers and organisations in the telecoms sector. The objective of this project is to reduce the effect of SMS spam by correctly detecting and filtering undesirable texts in real time.
